OpenNIC JSON
============


Unofficial API which provides details on OpenNIC DNS servers and TLDs.

* monitor.py - run periodically via cron to update servers, SOAs, uptime etc.
* web.js - node.js script to make JSON available over http and order servers by distance.
* data/ - stores JSON files and uptime database generated by monitor.py.

Run web.js using node.js, including the desired port to listen on. For example:

`node web.js 3000`

I suggest you put this behind a reverse proxy such as nginx.
